# 106bombyx
My 6th math project made in Python language

Project point :

            If a generation is crowded, chances are that the next generation will be crowded too, regarding the natu-ral rules of reproduction. But resources may lack for this new generation, so it may not be able to develop.Therefore, the number of bombyx depends on those two contradictory factors, and its evolution is far from trivial.

            Let’s call xi the number of the ith generation of butterflys. Here is a model for the evolution of xi:

           {x1=nwherenis the number of first generation individualsxi+1=kxi1000−xi1000,fori≥1,k being the growth rate, from 1 to 4.In order to study this evolution, you are asked to plot two things:•The curve representing the number of individuals in relation to the generation (varying from 1 to 100);

         •A synthetic scheme summing all the results for a givenn; it consists in plotting every value of xi(between two given bounds), in relation tok(kvarying from 1 to 4 by 0.01 steps).In both cases, your program shall print on the standard outuput the values to be entered intognuplottodraw the graphs.
