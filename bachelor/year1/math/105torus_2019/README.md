# 105torus_2019
A math project in first year at epitech. Drawing circles, cylinders and cones is a good start for an image synthesis software, but one have to admitit is not fully satisfying. . . This project ishould allow you to drawmore complex forms, such as a torus, which do not emerge from 2nd degree equations, but from superiordegree equations (4th degree in the torus case).The objective of this project is to solve a 4th degree equation: a4^4+a3^3+a2^2+a1^1+a0= 0. A directresolution method does exist (Ferrari’s method), but does not generalize to higher degrees. Thus, we willrather compare 3 iterative algorithms: •The bisection method, •Newton’s method, •The secant method.
