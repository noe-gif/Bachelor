This is the first math project in first year at epitech. Pong, an arcade game developped in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first ever successful video game. Itwas inspired by the very first video game,Tennis for Two, developped in 1958 by William Higinbotham onan oscilloscope.The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of theBreakoutgame. . . ). Only one paddlewill be considered, located in the(Oxy)plane (which is defined by the equationz= 0).Bounces on the paddle and game over will not be taken into account; in other words,only the motion of the ballwill be considered, regardless of the context.Your program must print:
• The velocity vector of the ball,
• The coordinates of the ball after a given amount of time,
• The angle at which the ball will hit the paddle (if it will actually hit it, at anytime from t = 0).
